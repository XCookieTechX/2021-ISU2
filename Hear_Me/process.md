# How to get the flag
1. Download the audio file provided
1. Upload the file to any software or tool that can view the spectrogram of the audio file
1. In the spectrogram of the audio file, you should see the code "W5acH#_L*o97G_At%" (you might need to mess around with the colors and logs of the spectrogram to see it clearly)
1. Then use steghide to extract the flag with the parameters of the audio file provided and the password as "W5acH#_L*o97G_At%" which is the code that you just got
1. You should then get the output of the key file which is "cdc{Seeing_isn't_beleiving___beleiving_is_seeing}"
